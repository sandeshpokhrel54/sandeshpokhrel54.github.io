Laymen use this phrase to say why they don’t need the Pythagoras Theorem; it is alike for engineers too. Because you cannot see that topic in your conscionable future you feel your efforts worthless. However it’s not that that you would never need it but that you cannot see it in use or you using it that repels you from exploring further in that topic.</p> <p>One of such hard to grasp and find-yourself-excited-about topics for computer engineers is Digital Signal Processing. Even though they know it is extremely important they don’t see much use in their efforts at understanding the topic maybe because of the failure to see direct practical implications. Convolution and cross-correlation and what not.</p> <p>Let me tell you something fam, if you’ve used your mouse today you’ve used cross-correlation and we’re going to learn how.</p> <p>If your mouse is from the 90s and it has a rolling ball underneath, you are in a dire need for update. If it’s optical then you’re using cross-correlation once every 60 microsecond.</p> <p><em>I wanna know, have you ever looked underneath your mouse?</em></p> <h2 id="lets-dive-in">Let’s dive in.</h2> <p>An optical mouse uses a light-emitting diode (LED) to detect movement, as opposed to the traditional mechanical mouse that uses a rolling ball. It works by shining the LED or infrared(in latest models) onto the surface beneath the mouse to <em>detect changes</em> as the mouse is moved. The mouse then sends this information to the computer, which translates it into cursor movement on the screen.</p> <p>You see that little <em>detect changes</em> part, that’s where the fun happens. An optical mouse depending on its model takes pictures at the rate of 1000s of frames per second of a tiny area underneath the mouse. With that the mouse is able to capture 100s of frame even for the smallest movement of the mouse. The frames captured are not even stored by the mouse but only used to compute the distance the mouse moved in the split second.</p> <p>Now to extract the information of how much and in which direction the mouse moved, a chip inside the mouse (digital signal processing chip) computes the cross correlation between two images captured in succession.</p> <h3 id="what-even-is-cross-correlation">What even is cross correlation?</h3> <p>Cross correlation in signal processing is a measure of similarity between two functions which is also called <em>sliding inner-product or sliding dot product.</em> It is a popular method used in pattern recognition and searching for features in signals. In single dimension the formula for computing cross correlation between two functions looks something like this:</p> <p>\(IoF(n)= \sum_{i=-N}^{N}I(i)F(n+i)\)<br/> Because an image is just an array of 2-dimensional discrete signals we can apply the same formula with an additional parameter for dimensionality.</p> <p>\(IoF(x,y) = \sum_{j=-N}^{N}\sum_{i=-N}^{N}I(i,j)F(x+i,y+j)\)<br/> </p> <p>where I is the image, and F is the filter or template we are correlating with the image.</p> <p>This process of locating the identical features of one signal in another is known as <em>template matching,</em> extensively used in computer vision, pattern recognition and signal analysis.</p> <p>Enough math and terminology, let us see what I mean with an example.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/mouse-math/leoToast-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/mouse-math/leoToast-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/mouse-math/leoToast-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mouse-math/leoToast.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>Custom Mousepad</em></p> <p>For some reason, this is the custom mousepad your girlfriend chose as your birthday gift.</p> <p>You plug in your mouse, on the new mousepad and load <em>Valorant</em>. The following is the image the mouse sees placed on Leo’s eye as you start moving around looking for the enemy. **</p> <p><em>The image I have here is a bit larger than what a typical mouse would capture(40x40).</em></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/mouse-math/leoeye-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/mouse-math/leoeye-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/mouse-math/leoeye-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mouse-math/leoeye.png" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>I in equation and eye in picture.</em></p> <p>Say you moved your mouse aiming for that head and now the mouse sees this next image.</p> <p>You moved your mouse such that the eye which was in the middle of the first capture is now in the <em>top left half</em> of the image, the rest we are discarding for illustration purposes, bear in mind that this is microseconds apart.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/mouse-math/leoeye_temp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/mouse-math/leoeye_temp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/mouse-math/leoeye_temp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mouse-math/leoeye_temp.png" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>F in the equation</em></p> <p>Now we need to find where exactly this second image coincides with the first. This is where we onload the math to do its work.</p> <p>Thankfully it is pretty simple to demonstrate in python with a few lines of code, however in an actual mouse these computations would be embedded into the system chip so that you can enjoy your game at a blazing fast speed with exceptional precision.</p> <p>The code is pretty straight forward and comments above the lines indicate what is actually happening.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">#necessary imports

One utterance was all it took to change our itinerary from <em>Tilicho</em> to <em>Thorong La</em>. But we didn’t get ahead of ourselves since we still had one more day of CIT left, however it was safe to be prepared just in case, so we packed crampons and a bit of extra supplies at <em>Chame</em>.</p> <p><strong>The stars above Mt. Manaslu.</strong> </p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/manaslu-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/manaslu-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/manaslu-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/manaslu.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>Astrophotography at 2 degrees below zero.</em></p> <h2 id="the-lost-projector">The Lost Projector</h2> <p><em>I need to know now, can you love me again.</em> </p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/t_-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/t_-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/t_-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/t_.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>Tanki Manang</em></p> <p>We were to fall in love with Manang once more, this time without the obligations of the duty at hand. Our plan was to now reach <em>Thangsar,</em> the same day we completed CIT. After a warm lunch of <em>thukpa,</em> we packed our bags and left to explore <em>Tanki Manang</em> before bidding goodbye to <em>Hotel Lake View.</em></p> <p>We arrived to the hotel after exploring <em>Tanki Manang</em> for about an hour. We were going to hand the projector to the hotel owner in order to take it to <em>Besisahar</em> the next day. He’s where the plot changed course, the projector was nowhere to be found.</p> <p>‘Collateral Damage’ meant that we wouldn’t be paid what we had been promised.</p> <p>How could we be so stupid? Who had it last? Who saw it last? We were irritated and searching everywhere for the projector. The housekeeper had not had a sight of it.</p> <p>A shopkeeper from across the hotel told us that someone took the projector towards the village. This was another twist since up to now we believed that it was misplaced. Now we get an intel that someone took it.</p> <p>Why on earth would someone take away the flex? The projector understandable, the flex…damn. After about two hours of scampering for the projector we lost any hope that it would be found. As we were about to leave <em>Manang</em>, we saw a CCTV camera mounted outside a hotel door. Another hour gone skipping past the footage of the last three hours. The sun was long gone, it was getting dark and now if we moved out we wouldn’t reach <em>Thangsar</em> on time, we had to return back.</p> <p>Gloom filled us on bright full moon night and we were in a state of complete torpor.</p> <p>That gloomy environment was disturbed by the housekeeper calling us out. We rushed to see her.</p> <p><em>“Vai tapaiharu lai high lacha kyao?”</em></p> <p><em>“Chaina hola dd, kina teso vannuvayo?”</em></p> <p><em>“Ani ka aarko room ma lagera rakhya ta projector, aafno room vanera store ma lagera rakhnuvayecha kya?”</em></p> <p>Getting our hands on the projector felt like holding a long lost child. A warm poker-filled night followed the events of the day. Talks with fellow trekkers ensued, sharing each others music preferences, hobbies and profession, but above all the love for travel. We lay in bed discussing conspiracy theories of ‘The Lost Projector’.</p> <h2 id="asphyxiation">Asphyxiation</h2> <p><em>Do you know what it feels like to sleep on the lap of the mountain?</em></p> <p>The hot fresh baked bread filled our room with an aroma early morning. Peanut butter and bread had given us enough energy to get the move on, the destination for the day, Tilicho Base Camp.</p> <p>One of our friends hadn’t adjusted well to <em>Tanki Manang</em> the second day and as we started ascending he felt heavier. We waited for about an hour from the top of a small hillock overlooking the majestic valley of <em>Tanki Manang</em> under unrelenting mountains, as beautiful as they are, they are also unforgiving. He didn’t seem to acclimatize well. When he couldn’t take it any more we decided to descend for a while. He admitted feeling a lot better after climbing down only a few steps.</p> <p><em>Not meant to be.</em></p> <p>The team of seven was down to six. He gave us the green light to go on while returned to the hotel we had stayed last night. Leaving a friend who was most excited about this travel put a dent in our hearts, but health before all and with a promise to continue this journey some other day we walked towards <em>Thangsar</em>.</p> <p>Through suspension bridges, early morning winds and dusty road, we reached <em>Thangsar</em> at about 11AM.</p> <p>We went to a nearby pharmacy and got scammed well and good, but with what other option did we have. “Bloody hell she charged us Rs. 600 for ‘NOT FOR SALE’ medicine(Vitamin C, Vitamin B)”. After lunch, we rested under the canopy of yet another mountain, a recurring theme on our travel.</p> <p>Rivulets flowing from tall hills to meet the <em>Marsyangdi</em> below running along the mountains that stood like a wall across us. The ascend to <em>Shreekharka</em> was steep. Following another dusty trail alongside load-carrying donkeys we reached <em>Shreekharka</em> at about 3pm. Staring across the cliff, one could only imagine how on Earth is this piece of rock across us so intriguing. </p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/Shreekharka-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/Shreekharka-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/Shreekharka-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/Shreekharka.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>Shreekharka</em></p> <p>After some sugary diet of chocolates and dates we were ready to march but the trail ensured that there would be no quick marches but a slow and steady race with the sun to Tilicho Base Camp.</p> <p>As we trekked along, we were greeted by the sounds of blue sheep baying, trying to blend in with the sparse vegetation and the snow that had yet to melt under the sun’s warmth. The terrain soon changed, and we found ourselves navigating through <em>the landslide area</em>. The ground beneath our feet rocky and unstable, and we had to tread carefully to avoid losing our balance. Carrying the behemoth <em>alienware</em> all the while, it was on this day I realized how much I loved my laptop. The bag I had been carrying was a 70<em>l</em> trekking bag inside of which was another laptop bag for protection. The bag had been so heavy that we used a terminology for it, the mighty <em>Vhagar</em>. Apart from this bag there was one more handbag that lingered on about our sides which had the microcontrollers and hardware which we had demonstrated in CIT.</p> <p>The beauty of the surrounding landscape made the effort worth it, with snow-capped peaks towering above us and the valley below and stretching out as far as the eye could see. We were in awe of the nature around us, and grateful for the opportunity to experience it firsthand.</p> <p>By the time we reached <em>Tilicho Base Camp</em>, the sun was long gone and the mountains shone in the moonlight. Tired and cold we threw our bags in our room, and rested in the warm and cozy dining room with a central heater surrounded by trekkers. After about half an hour of rest, my mind now looked for ways to get engaged with the crowd in the dining hall. I spotted a group playing chess, and my night was decided. We played chess at 4150m above sea level. In case you’re wondering, I won the games, thanks in no small part to the whiskey that my opponent was chugging all the while he moved his pieces. Before we went to bed, we decided we would leave for Tilicho at 3AM to be at the mercy of the winds.</p> <h2 id="exclamation">Exclamation</h2> <p>Our minds were so fixated on leaving at 3AM that we forgot about the importance of breakfast. As we set off for Tilicho on that cold, dark, and starry night, our empty stomachs began to gnaw at us.</p> <p>The water froze inside our bottles, which made it impossible for us to quench our thirst. On top of that, some of us suffered from gastritis, which made the arduous climb even more unbearable. Despite our hunger, we found ourselves wanting nothing to eat, and we relied on a single granola bar to keep us going.</p> <p>As we continued to climb alongside the mountain, we soon came across a snow desert that we were thankfully well prepared for. We had crampons, which made our progress easier than it would have been otherwise. We had to carefully navigate the treacherous terrain, cracking and crunching ice underneath our feet as we went.</p> <p>We finally reached Tilicho after four grueling hours. Exhausted and cold, I took a much-needed rest before I could appreciate the stunning view that lay before me. It was a memorable experience that tested our limits and made us appreciate the beauty of nature even more. The fun however had only just began as a helicopter started landing bicycles just a few paces from where we stood flattening anyone who stood close to the icy ground. They were cycling their way down from the Tilicho lake.</p> <p><em>Blue and pristine. Tilicho</em> </p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/tilicho-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/tilicho-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/tilicho-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/tilicho.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>The wind was so cold that you couldn’t feel your hands. No one dared to take off their gloves. Rubbing hands and passing the phone around quick, we took turns capturing the moments. Descending on the slippery ice which had started to melt under the sun, it took us another two hours. These two hours were extremely long and frustrating because of hunger. After reaching the base camp we had lunch and checked our Oxygen levels to make sure we were fit to continue. Although the Oxygen level seemed fine, I didn’t feel well at all. The toughest day of all the days of trek for me. My head pounding and my lungs panting and gasping for air. Might have also been because I hadn’t taken <em>Acetazolamide,</em> the medicine for altitude sickness even while climbing up to Tilicho.</p> <p><em>The lovely tales</em></p> <p>To take my mind off my pounding head and panting lungs while we walked back to <em>Shreekharka</em> my <em>chad</em> friend discussed all the golden and unspoken rules of dating. I didn’t keep track of a lot of things but by the time we reached our destination we were up to chapter six of the presumed book we were discussing. Thanks to these small talks and heavy lifting of <em>Vhagar</em> by my <em>homies</em> we were all in one piece come evening.</p> <p>With how difficult the day had been, my mind started to wonder if I could make it to <em>Thorong La</em> at all, with what right would I wear the headband I had bought that said <em>Thorong La (5410m)</em>. A good meal and sound sleep was all I needed. One pill would now decide my fate for the next day, <em>flexon.</em></p> <h2 id="resurgence">Resurgence</h2> <p>And sure enough come morning, the magic pill had brought me back my strength and the will to climb. We didn’t repeat yesterday’s mistake, we had a toast and omelette with milk peanut butter and jam.</p> <p>As we began our trek, we quickly noticed the treacherous conditions of the trail. It appeared as though the path was covered in a thin layer of ice, which was camouflaged beneath a layer of dust. Despite our best efforts to carefully assess the ground with our trekking sticks, we still found ourselves slipping and sliding on more than one occasion.</p> <p>The terrain reminded us of a similar path we had taken from <em>Tanki Manang to Thangsar</em>. The narrow trail wound its way through the rugged landscape, forcing us to cross bridges and traverse dusty roads as we made our way uphill. Despite the challenges, the stunning views and sense of accomplishment made every step worth it.</p> <p>Our trekking group set out with the intention of reaching <em>Yakkharka</em> and eventually <em>Phedi</em>. The journey was filled with anticipation and excitement as we were eager to explore the beautiful landscapes that lay ahead. However, as we continued on our path, the weather took a turn for the worse and it started snowing. We knew that we couldn’t continue in such conditions and decided to stop for the day at <em>Ledar</em>, a picturesque spot that was covered in snow. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we were able to enjoy a magical night, surrounded by the snow-covered mountains.</p> <p>An old trekking guide accompanied us at dinner, a social gathering the cold weather commenced as everyone in the hall tuned in to listen to the words of wisdom from the man who had spent his life on mountains. He was guiding a mountaineer to climb Annapurna South but due to adverse conditions they would be trying on a mountain which would be much easier. That distinctive red jacket holding up a bottle of hot local alcohol will always make me cheer when I think of my trekking memories. Our dinner that day was a comforting one with cheesy pizza, cheese bombed spaghetti and <em>thukpa</em> each worth every single rupee. While the restaurants in big cities like Pokhara and Kathmandu are busy scamming customers with their extravagant pricing and below average food, <em>Ledar</em> served us the food that will hold a special place in our heart and stomach.</p> <p>Early morning after a breakfast of mixed vegetables and potatoes, we hit the road with a group of other trekkers who had been halted by the snow. Our destination: <em>High Camp</em>. Two roads led to our destination. <em>Punpun</em> and I decided to follow an experienced trekker and took the shortcut, while others had already moved onto the a longer and more comfortable road. The shorter road we took was approximately 150 meters lower in altitude to the longer road that went uphill and came down again. The trail we followed was a dangerous one, with stones sliding down from hill tops at some places, making the journey even more thrilling. Despite the danger, we were able to appreciate the stunning views of the surrounding mountains and one of the clicks from this road is a wallpaper on my phone. </p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/valley-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/valley-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/valley-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/valley.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>The valley</em></p> <p>At <em>Phedi</em>, we regrouped and had lunch before beginning our ascent to <em>High Camp</em>. The climb was steep, with an incline of approximately 45 degrees, and it took us nearly an hour to reach our destination due to the thin air and our tired legs. However, the effort was well worth it once we reached the 4910m high view point at <em>High Camp</em>. Despite the extreme winds, we could not deny the stunning view of the curved valley and the icy glaciers, which seemed ready to drop from the mountain crevasses. We took our time to fully take in the breathtaking scenery, admiring the beauty of the surrounding nature and the peacefulness of the moment.</p> <p>Hot ramen soup filled our bellies for the evening. We sat around playing cards and making small talk with the guests in the dining hall. It was the end of the season for trekkers and the dinning was crowded like all places with the almost last batch of travelers. Light snow fell and made the atmosphere colder.</p> <p><em>In between the cover of another perfect wonder and it’s so white as snow.</em></p> <p>I took no chances, the thoughts of the repeat of <em>Tilicho</em> made me take a pill for high altitude after dinner. We decided <em>satu, dates</em> and <em>milk peanut butter</em> as our breakfast before going to sleep.</p> <h2 id="vindication">Vindication</h2> <p><em>Thou shall not pass.</em></p> <p>Sleep was hard to come by due to the altitude. We were woken up by the sounds in the room next to us, they were preparing to leave already, it was 4am. The winds once the sun shines would be merciless. About an hour or so later we were also ready depart.</p> <p>Trekking stick, check, crampon, check, <em>Vhagar</em> check, <em>red bull</em> check and my workout playlist check. Nothing was going to stop us, not gastritis, not headache, not altitude nor a snow storm. Blasting the music on my phone on a dim lit night we set off.</p> <p><em>Under wandering stars I’ve grown by myself but not alone - Wherever I may roam</em></p> <p>“<em>Nice music choice”</em></p> <p><em>“Oh, thanks”</em></p> <p><em>“Don’t you think it will disturb others”</em></p> <p><em>“That’s why I’m trying to move away as quickly as I can”</em></p> <p><em>“Don’t seem to me like you moving quick”</em></p> <p><em>“Quicker than you, it seems”</em></p> <p><em>“You challenging an American Son?”</em></p> <p><em>“You should know I’m a Gorkhali.”</em></p> <p><em>“Let’s see who gets to the top first then”</em></p> <p>A challenge was just what I needed to get the spring in my steps.</p> <p>The trail was extreme, if you could call it a trail. The dawn was upon us and winds started getting extreme as we moved towards the pass. The road was snowy and brittle icicles topped everything around. There would be gusts of strong winds when you could do nothing but try not to fall on the thick ice below. Icy shards were entering your jackets, your cap, gloves and shoes, the cold unbearable. A progression of iron poles striped with colors were placed to indicate the direction of the trail. The ice blowing in the wind struck the iron poles making them chime. Nature itself was in mood for music it seemed. So violent yet so pleasant. <em>The Pass</em></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/pass-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/pass-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/pass-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/pass.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>Ah mountains, you love them, you hate them but you can’t stay away from them.</em></p> <p>After an adventure fraught with danger the holy grail was there in front of us. <em>Thorong La Pass</em> welcomed us with the sound of fluttering <em>buddhist flag</em>. The small crammed hut came with a sense of relief after a long and hard climb. <em>The Pass</em> was just as reluctant to us taking pictures as <em>Tilicho.</em></p> <p>I might climb mountains and passes but never would I ever have my laptop with me throughout the journey. A few eyebrows raised when I took my laptop out at the top. My beloved and I also clicked a picture, me holding her ever so protectively.</p> <h2 id="bargain-with-the-gods">Bargain with the Gods</h2> <p>The journey through the snowy hills had been nothing short of awe-inspiring. The crisp, fresh air filled our lungs, and the snow crunching beneath our feet was music to our ears. Every step was a struggle, as the thick snow made the terrain treacherous, but the view of the majestic mountains surrounding us made it all worth it.</p> <p><em>Muktinath</em> awaited us on the other side of the pass.</p> <p>However, the descent from the mountain pass was not going to be an easy one. The steep slope and the slippery snow made the journey down a treacherous one. We had to be cautious with every step, ensuring we didn’t lose our footing and tumble down the mountainside.</p> <p>As we made our way down, the snow-covered hillsides seemed to stretch out endlessly before us, creating an otherworldly and surreal landscape. The mountains still surrounded us from all directions, and their grandeur was truly humbling. We couldn’t help but feel small in their presence. The descent was also an exhilarating experience. The feeling of sliding down the snowy hills, the wind whipping through our hair, and the thrill of adventure filled us with excitement. It was an experience that we would cherish forever.</p> <p>Finally, we reached the bottom of the slope and <em>Muktinath</em> was right in front of us, welcoming us with open arms.</p> <p>It hadn’t been a week since last I visited <em>Muktinath.</em> Circumstances had it that I was bargaining with <em>Lord Bishnu</em> for the third time under the lap of <em>Himalayas</em>. A visit to <em>Muktinath</em> would feel incomplete without the daring act of bathing in 108 stone taps with bone chilling cold water and a dip in the mind numbingly cold ponds in front of the temple.</p> <p><em>All the pain and the sins of life washed away.</em></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/muktinath-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/muktinath-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/muktinath-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aftermath-of-cit/muktinath.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>Muktinath</em></p> <p>We had planned to stay in a hotel in <em>Jomsom</em> that day. Haggling for the price of the <em>jeep</em> to take us to <em>Jomsom,</em> we met a driver who even had the courtesy to book us a hotel and a bus for departure to Pokhara the next day. An anecdote that cannot be missed from our travel was that of our expert drivers. The thing that fascinated me most was their ability to multitask while navigating such rusty terrains. Only their left had would be at the job full-time, the right always busy in making phone calls, preparing tobacco or smoking cigarettes. After shopping for souvenirs at <em>Jomson</em> and a delicious <em>Thakali thali,</em> we went to bed.</p> <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2> <p><em>“You know there’s something about a tangle of strangers pressed together for days on end with nothing in common but the need to go from one place to another, then never to see each other again.” - Bouc (Murder on Orient Express)</em></p> <p>Early morning the next day, rocking and swaying with the road we returned to Pokhara. Tired legs looking for some much needed rest rode along in the seven hour journey back to Earth from heaven.

Their tin-roofed school lies at the bottom of a mountain behemoth, with only the mid-day sun offering enough warmth for them to play outside. The rest of the day they remain sheltered inside the classrooms insulated with wood, but even that isn’t enough during harsh winters when the snow is sometimes knee-deep and the schools remain closed for months. We were mere visitors but to these children born and raised in snow, this was their home, their heaven, and the source of their originality and pride.</p> <p>Annapurna Secondary School</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Annapurna-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Annapurna-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Annapurna-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Annapurna.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="timang">Timang</h2> <p>Cliched as it may sound, it’s the journey that matters and not the destination. This rings even truer when you are a group of 12 cramped in a 7-seater Bolero, with one of the guys practically in the driver’s seat and barely wiggling about to allow the driver to handle the gear. Add to the fact that the road from Besisahar (Lamjung) towards Manang is probably the bumpiest you’ve seen all your life and the winds are already freezing cold at 4 PM, and you have one unique ride to savor for your aching back.</p> <blockquote> <p>“You went through pitch-black tunnels (which were actually pretty good compared to the other parts), under waterfalls, through rivulets, and at some places, it was akin to a vehicle getting up the stairs.”</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><em>An ‘oversimplified’ description of the Manang road</em></li> </ul> <p>We had just arrived at Timang at 8 PM only to be welcomed by the ‘trust the internet before you trust your phone reception’ experience - moving 10 steps in any arbitrary direction meant signal loss but the Wi-Fi signal was a clear, full bar. Puzzling. We squiggled inside our blankets and huddled together in a futile attempt to stay warm.</p> <p>In the morning, the class rep stood before the paintings of the national animal, national flower, and national color on the walls as she gathered everyone and provided instructions on cleaning duties. Some ran to the football ground to collect litter while some visited classrooms, wiping every speck of dust. Since government schools cannot afford a lot of staff, the cleanliness duty falls upon the students - a great way to incorporate discipline and a sense of responsibility from a young age.</p> <p>Children from classes 6 to 10 could barely fill half the music room, yet we could feel that this was the most gracious crowd we had since the start of the campaign. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that the children in Manang had good internet access and they were even able to answer most of our internet quiz questions. Their understanding of internet safety including topics like online sexual abuse, grooming, phishing, hacking, and other issues was a bit lacking, but that’s what we were there for, and we explained them in the most Layman terms we could.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Once the winter arrives, we can’t open the schools for teaching so the students must descend to the hills to get their winter studies in or resort to staying indoors. We are thinking of sending two of our students to the Budhanilkantha School in Kathmandu, although we have heard the entrance exams are quite tough…”,</p> </blockquote> <p><em>- Principal of Shree Gaurishankar Aadharbhut Bidhyalaya, Timang</em></p> <p>The English teacher instructed the 5 students gathered around him on the football ground to recite the story in turns. This mini-class could only go for about a month before the school shut its doors to the falling of snow. We glanced longingly and reminisced about our childhood until the afternoon sun signaled the motion toward our next destination.</p> <h2 id="chame">Chame</h2> <p>It was at Chame that we finally met our lord and savior Mr. Santosh Dai. A phone call from him could have saved the Titanic - from contacting the local schools to arranging rides and hotel inns, Santosh Dai was the reason why we could endeavor CIT in Manang all in one fell swoop. Dear Santosh Dai, if you ever find a copy of The Zerone lying around as you sip your favorite tea, know that you have our sincere gratitude.</p> <p>The Lokpriya School in Chame seemed precariously close to the flowing river. There were stone cut marks of the flood that had almost drowned (and certainly closed) the school the previous year. The riverside breeze couldn’t get any colder as we firmly gritted our teeth and made our way to the classrooms.</p> <p>Teaching is a perplexing skill. Here we were, teaching how to code a GCD calculator to children who probably hadn’t written a ‘Hello, World’ program in their life, and the very next thing we were teaching about safe internet usage. Sometimes, it required establishing relativity by mentioning PUBG and Free Fire as marvels of game development. Other times we had to spend 5 minutes explaining why ‘Alan Turing is called the father of AI’, only to end up right where we started with the children scratching their heads in one synchronous motion. One of us had to run to the market to fetch the pens for the internet quiz - when asked for the bill, he was simply handed a white, torn piece of paper with ‘पेन - 100’ written in the most illegible handwriting on it. Our finance coordinator was not going to have an easy time explaining this.</p> <p>With the taste of warm <em>jerry puri</em> still lingering on our lips, we boarded the jeep to Tanki Manang. Half of our crew got to ride outside in the back of the vehicle as the ever-changing landscapes ran past us. Barren hills crowned by snow-covered peaks, apple orchards growing around ponds and puddles, dry autumn leaves swirling around, and waves of emotions crashing in our hearts. One can only hold their breath for so long.</p> <h2 id="tanki-manang">Tanki Manang</h2> <p>Annapurna School was a field day for our hardware instructor. The batteries gave out due to the cold and the induction coil stopped working for some unknown reason, but the children were having the time of their lives spinning the makeshift dynamo as fast as they could. We could imagine the questions inside their head as they moved their hands closer and farther toward the ultrasonic sensor to make the LED blink.</p> <p>Oh, what joy can simple things bring in life!</p> <blockquote> <p>“Who wants to see us flying a drone?” “What? Drone? We have seen that hundreds of times…”</p> </blockquote> <p>Guess drones aren’t ‘simple’ enough.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Since you are the only student in your class, we don’t even need to do a lucky draw for your LOCUS t-shirt. Come claim it!”</p> </blockquote> <p>The privilege of being the only student in an entire class. The girl gave an amused laugh as she collected her prize and went back to her corner. Class 9 had one student, class 8 had around 7, and class 10 had 5. A handful bunch, nonetheless.</p> <p>The afternoon sun was merciful but when the cold wind struck us after midday we had to push down hard on our jacket pockets. That didn’t matter to the kids though as they ran out to the basketball court whenever we paused for a 10 minutes break. A boy with only one hand was chucking in free throws with ease. A girl proclaimed herself as the best photographer in school and scolded us to get our poses right.</p> <p>The sky was a clear blue, the gurgling, premature Marsyangdi added ambiance to the air, and the Gangapurna mountain dawned upon us within touching distance. Despite the harsh weather and rural living standards, the simplicity of life gleams through the smiles of the happy children in the playgrounds of Manang.</p> <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2> <p>The stuff that happens behind the curtain never does make it onto the stage, but one can always take a sneak peek. You will not get to read the story of the quiet prayers and the bargains we made with God as the altitude got higher and the snow got colder. You’ll definitely not hear about us losing our minds over the projector we ‘misplaced’ during our stay at Tanki Manang. The look of horror on our faces as the tap water froze during early morning toilet ‘rituals’. Chowing down on yak cheese pizza at over 4000m as if it was the last meal of our lives.</p> <p>Dragging our feet along the mountain trail at 3 AM on an empty stomach. Hauling the massive beast of a laptop all the way through the Thorang La pass.</p> <p>Getting battered and bamboozled by snowstorms. Remembering your loved ones and wishing they could have been here to witness mother nature in all her glory.</p> <p>Asphyxiation. Vindication. Exclamation.</p> <h2 id="diaries-of-other-provinces">Diaries of other provinces</h2> <p><em>The LOCUS 2023 Children in Technology (CIT) program was conducted alongside the Internet Education Program (IEP) supported by ChildSafeNet and WorldLink Communications. As a part of CIT, we introduced children to technologies such as electromagnetics, transformers, programming, motors, house wiring, and more, while through the IEP, in parallel, we taught the children secure use of the internet and tackled challenging topics of online addiction, abuse, bullying, scams and more. The program was conducted in 6 provinces and over 50 schools. Here are some excerpts from some other teams from LOCUS.</em></p> <p>“Maybe because the students were in early teens, we observed open responsiveness when discussing on topics such as sexual abuse and exploitation…During a quiz, one student immediately provided the correct answer for the helpline number 1098. To our surprise, she informed us that she had actively volunteered at the district’s helpline station.”</p> <p><em>- Shree Himalaya Madhyamik Vidyalaya, Province 1, Team Khadbari</em></p> <p>“The program went smoothly, despite the presence of uninterested and noisy students…One incident that stood out to us was when as a reward for winning a quiz, a girl chose to take a pen instead of the other attractive prize available. We gave it to her, and that was all she wanted.”</p> <p><em>- Nepal Rastriya Madhyamik Bidhayala, Province 2, Team Madhesh Pradesh</em></p> <p>“There were no conventional means of transportation so we had to walk for nearly 4 hours, asking for directions to the school…Just so it happened, there was a blackout due to a nearby faulty transformer. We could not use a projector, so instead relied on our laptops and verbal prowess for presentations.”</p> <ul> <li><em>Kalika Secondary School, Team Gandaki, Bandipur and Ghandruk</em></li> </ul> <p>“Students there had good exposure to social media but not enough knowledge of its safe use…One of the students shared his experience of losing his FreeFire account when he clicked a link that he believed would give him in-game currency for free while some shared their experiences of receiving scam messages on WhatsApp.”</p> <p><em>- Bhimnagar Secondary School, Team Bagmati Province</em></p> <p>“The school was entirely free and well-equipped with sophisticated technology, making it easy for us to conduct the campaign. They had their own projectors, speakers, cameras, and internet facilities which greatly aided us in delivering our content. The students were also very disciplined and eager to learn.”</p> <p><em>- Kopila Valley Academy, Team Surkhet, Province 6</em></p> <p>“One of the students shared the addictive experience of gaming and his horror when he faced the consequences of bare minimum marks in exams. The event became suddenly interesting when one of the students sang in front of all the students…The earthquake of 6.1 mags with epicenter ar Doti occurred that night. We spent 2 hours outside that cold night with the company of firewood and locals.”</p> <ul> <li><em>Ghatal Ma.

The burning fire of youth in us could only be quenched by a trek that demanded every last bit of effort from us.</p> <p>In the back of my mind was the thought of having missed Langtang Trek, a few months ago due to the uncertainty of having practical classes in the middle of the vacation. So it was one of the first places I suggested and everyone went along without second thought.</p> <p>With the destination decided, it was time to recruit. About seven of us were already on for it within a couple of days. Permissions and circumstances fluctuated the number often, but when it all settled, the company was just enough to field a football team.</p> <h2 id="the-start">The Start</h2> <p><em>T- 20 hours:</em> The bikers among us went to Machha Pokhari to get tickets to Syaphru Besi. We took the ticket for 6:20 in the morning but the announced time was 5:30, so that everyone would arrive on time.</p> <p><em>T-12 hours:</em> It was time to pack our bags with essentials. Groceries including peanut butter, chocolates, wafers, <em>bhujiya</em>, peanuts, dozens of orea and instant noodles. I also packed <em>satu</em> and <em>bhuteko makai</em>. We then went to a pharmacy to grab some glucose, <em>jiwan jal</em>, <em>bandages</em>, pain relief spray, paracetamol, painkillers, acetazolamide and sunscreen.</p> <p>We started packing our bags and it was evident that we had bought too much food so had to leave some of our supplies to make our bags lighter.</p> <p>Travel anxiety made sleep hard to come by as I slept only 4 hours.</p> <p><em>T-2 hours:</em> I woke up and started banging on everyone’s door urging them to get ready.</p> <p><em>T-1 hour:</em> We were ready, just as we were clicking some pictures of the start of our journey, early morning bird dropping greeted us on the way out of the campus premise, which is considered a good omen. A stroke of coincidence as a superstitious belief came true since we found a bus in the pitch black of morning with an unusual route that took us right to our destination</p> <p><em>T-1 hour actually:</em> I had lied about the time of departure to the guys so that they would arrive in time. We were an hour early and had time to break our fast on chickpeas and boiled eggs.</p> <p>Reminiscing about the times of the most adventurous bus ride on the return from <em>Sailung</em>, we enjoyed the roads that took us to Nuwakot district then to Rasuwa. As the bus started to ascend towards the hilltops the road started showing its true colors. We knew we were in for a ride when we saw above us the winding road that overlooked a river. Riding on the edge of the cliff we discussed Yak delicacies that we would enjoy on the trip. The list included milk, ghee, curd, cheese and <em>sukuti</em>.</p> <p>We climbed up to 2000m above the sea level at Dhunche, from where people going to Gosaikunda departed the bus and then we descended further on a curving snake like road down to 1450m.</p> <h2 id="run-forest">Run Forest</h2> <p>We got off at <em>Syabru Besi</em> and stretched ourselves for a moderate walk of 2 hours for the day. An itinerary map of what is to follow was displayed on a hoarding board, which we clicked for future references.</p> <p>We couldn’t have asked for a better start to our trek. A beautiful suspension bridge awaited us as a portal to the majestic Langtang Valley. The day was gloomy with clouds all around or was it pollution, it was hard to tell. Nonetheless we followed the trail running uphill alongside the river. Once in a while we would walk into a lush forest with the river roaring in the background and in another instance crossing the river or following it upstream on its banks. We reached <em>Doman</em> in no time, a slap across the face as we were charged Rs.100 for a bottle of mineral water, the place wasn’t even far from a highway.<br/> <em>Chuna</em></p> <p>We entered the eternal forest of the damned. With hills whose scale could not be contemplated casting shadows on us we moved onwards. Talking to strangers returning from their journey gave us a good idea of the landscape and a rough sketch of itinerary we could complete. It was 5:30pm by the time we reached Bamboo(1970m). A little bit of adversarial game between two hotels landed us a good price on accommodations for the night.</p> <h2 id="the-advance">The Advance</h2> <p>We charged like a calvary early morning, <em>satu</em> and biscuits fueled us for the morning. Our goal was to reach <em>Ghodatabela</em> for lunch. Armed with chocolates and <em>jiwan jal</em> we started our journey at 6:30 in the morning. The scenery was the same as yesterday, lush forest, the river roaring louder as the climb got a bit steeper. Large precipices engulfed the thin trail that we followed. Chatting up with strangers sharing the same destination was a fun part of the journey. We encountered Greeks, Slovenian, French, and others mainly European tourists who loved to share their travel experiences. Trekking guides who shared their hectic schedules of Spring and their luxury during the off-season made you want to adopt the profession.</p> <p>Fields of Rhododendron started entering the fray as we ascended, some hints of red on overhanging cliffs while white and pink dominated otherwise. Strong steel structure bridges cut across the river in several places. They facilitated travelers as well as Donkey’s carrying supplies to the upper parts of the valley.</p> <p>We came across a Yak shed. Newborn Yaks sitting idly and shy made for some good photographs. A cup of fresh curd filled us with the energy to continue onwards.</p> <p><em>One item on the list of delicacies ticked</em>.</p> <p>It was lunchtime, as planned when we reached <em>Ghodatabela</em>. Dal bhat, Kingly Beans, Cabbage and Mango pickle were served. After about an hour or so of lunchtime and rest we continued our advance, pushing for Kyanjing Valley.</p> <p>We had entered a separate terrain. The lush forests had fiddled out into short bushy trees and thin vegetation of rhododendron and sea thorn plants as we continued upstream. The valley was caving in from both sides with monumental hills.</p> <p>At about 6:00pm we reached a misty <em>Kyanjin Ghompa</em>. We were running on fumes by the time we got there. Little drizzle on the way had made our clothes wet. Finally the contents of the heavy bag were put to use with a change of clothes. We sat round the heater to warm ourselves whilst enjoying another delicacy from the list, Yak <em>sukuti</em> .Due to religious reasons fresh Yak meat is not available in this trekking route. However, Yaks that are too old and deceased are cut for meat, and dry-aged. For this reason the <em>sukuti</em> was dry and demanded some strength from our facial muscles.</p> <p>There were two peaks that we wanted to scale, Kyanjin Ri and Tserko Ri. After discussion we reached a conclusion to decide our peak in the morning based on weather to make sure the views from the top weren’t obstructed.</p> <h2 id="the-climb">The Climb</h2> <p><em>The Circle of Life</em> played and I opened my eyes without much excitement. The 12 hour walk yesterday had robbed me of my strength. Hoping that the day was misty so that I could get away with a moderate climb to ‘Kyanjin Ri’ for the day, I half-heartedly shifted the curtains just enough to have a peek outside.</p> <p>My sleepy eyes jerked open at the sight of <em>Langtang Lirung</em>.</p> <p><em>Astonishing</em>.</p> <p>I literally jumped off my bed and enunciated loudly the beauty of the <em>Langtang Lirung</em> as I rushed outside. I went from 0 to 100 in a fraction of a second.</p> <p><em>He’s gone mad.</em> Punpun exclaimed in a sleepy voice from his bed. He was not wrong. I had gone berserk, waking everyone up and disturbing every living creature that could hear.</p> <p>I dragged him off his bed to the hotel porch.</p> <p><em>Who’s the madman now?</em></p> <p>He staggered back and went through the phases that I had just been through. Slowly everyone was up and howling at the scenery.</p> <p>We had Tibetian bread and curry for breakfast and on for the climb to ‘Tserko Ri’.</p> <p>None of us asked for directions, nor knew which one among all those enormous peaks was ‘Tserko Ri’. But we just bodged through the trails, believing it would lead to our destination. After an hour or so of walking we came across a board that confirmed our hunch.</p> <p>My <em>running playlist</em>, Cloves and <em>Timur</em> acted as doping agents as we mounted one hilltop after another. We would stop here and there to appreciate the panorama of mountains and get a boost of energy through <em>jiwanjal</em> and <em>glucose</em>. Chocolates were also of great help to the empty stomach on the way up.</p> <p>As the Oxygen level goes down, your brain finds it is much easier to sit than walk up the steep hills and play tricks to make you stop every time you see a spot. I decided not to sit before I reached the top, just stand still to catch my breath once in a while.</p> <p>The climb had begun with a steep climb to a hillock. We continued on to another hillock and then another.</p> <p><em>Deja vu</em>.</p> <p>Amidst the climb of hillock we spotted Danphe and the Alpine Clough flying effortlessly. Extended wings gliding in them around the windy mountains. Sometimes they would just stay still in the air with wings wide apart. Magical.</p> <p>Some patches of cloud began to appear at a distance, rising from the valley, chasing us. Thus began the race to the top, shady clouds vs us. We had a good headstart but the race by no means was fair, the clouds soared while we clambered on all fours with slippery gravel giving way under our feet. We were lucky that the clouds didn’t know where to stop and we reached a clear top with the clouds having raced somewhere else.</p> <p><em>“The best view comes after the hardest climb.”</em></p> <p>Crystal clear glaciers just shy of the highest bare hills, glorious mountains with their heads held high, almost 360 degree in view, almost, because a thin slice of the view was that of the river basin extending to the Langtang valley and beyond.</p> <p>I roamed around at the windy top, shouted my love towards the mountains and they echoed back. The summit was not sparse in personnel count as many enthusiasts had made their way to the top. I tried to make smalltalk with a man who was engrossed in the majesty of the shiny peaks.</p> <p><em>‘No English seul Francias.’</em> I recognized that he didn’t understand English.</p> <p><em>‘C’est magnifique.’</em> I cleared out my <em>petit</em> French vocabulary.</p> <p><em>“C’est magnifique.”,</em> he nodded in agreement with a broad smile across his face.</p> <p>Snack and nap time. Oreos, some chocolates, electrolytes, glucose and <em>moong ko dal</em> were even more satisfying when followed by a nap. The playlist changed to <em>‘slow and feel good’</em>. I took a relaxing nap at 5000m above sea level.</p> <p>It was time to descend. Re-energized, we decided to follow an alternative path that was “easier” to descend. A few paces ahead and we were lost as the trail dwindled down and all we could see were the trails left by wild goats. After an hour of descent we realized we neither had descended as much as we should have nor were moving in the right direction. Hunger, thirst and tiredness factored in and everyone grew irritable and started taking a direct route downhill, steepish and ungroomed. Fueled by frustration we started jumping off rocks and sliding down the dry straw. We reached the valley in no time.</p> <p>During dinner, we crossed off another item from our list of delicacies. The ghee was potent. A small scoop was enough to give delightful aroma in my hands.</p> <p>The climb had taken a toll on everyone and no one had energy nor zeal left to summit the two peaks that we had initially planned. Even though the <em>Kyanjin Ri I and II</em> were not as demanding as <em>Tserko Ri</em>, <em>moral licensing</em> had come into effect and everyone wished to sleep rather than summit.</p> <h2 id="the-obsession">The Obsession</h2> <p>At the end of our discussion it was only me who was adamant at climbing <em>Kyanjin Ri</em>. But my good friends were even more stubborn at not letting me go solo, so an obsessive trio was ready to depart in the morning for <em>Kyanjin Ri.</em></p> <p><em>Kyanjin Ri</em> was moderately easy compared to the behemoth <em>Tserko Ri</em>, even though the way to the top wasn’t any less steeper. Oh and I almost forgot to mention that it had been 12 all along to the top of <em>Tserko Ri</em>, a beautiful Himalayan Sheepdog had followed us all the way and was now backready to follow us through our journey to <em>Kyanjin Ri</em>.</p> <p><em>“These stupid hoomans are surprisingly slow and must wait or they might get lost.”</em> - doggo</p> <p>The top of <em>Kyanjin Ri I</em>, was just as beautiful with the full glory of Langtang Lirung on display and a gorge leading to a small lake whose water was led to a micro hydropower plant.</p> <p>No time to waste as we pushed up the hill for <em>Kyanjin Ri II</em>. A mere 200m increase in elevation, puf.. easy peasy, but mother nature has her with overconfident crooks. The most frightening of all the trails arrived with a thin trail and on either side the stairway to heaven. <em>Not for the faint of heart.</em></p> <p>The elevation of the slope might just as well have been above 80 degrees.</p> <p>The top of <em>Kyanjin II</em> was worth it though. The rusty glacier as seen from <em>Tserko Ri</em> now looked pristine. You could see the vivid patterns of sharp clear icicles on the other side of the gorge and it felt like you could almost reach out and touch it.</p> <p><em>I reached out and it touched my soul.</em></p> <p>With a peaceful stay at the top, the journey was almost over, there were no more peaks to summit. We had left no peaks unsummited(at least the planned ones). A deep feeling of satisfaction ran through my veins as I crossed off the peaks from my list.</p> <p>A thunderous roar echoed across the mountains though the skies were dressed in blue. We turned our heads around puzzled. A snow-white cloud was falling from one of the slopes of Langtang Lirung. <em>An Avalanche</em>. Mother nature flexing again, we stood there and watched as the thick mop of white cloud shrinked into a thin flowing silver and the cloud flowed along down to the lake.</p> <h2 id="the-night-walkers">The Night Walkers</h2> <p>The boys were just waking up when we reached the hotel. A light breakfast and we left with the intention to reach <em>Lama Hotel</em>.</p> <p><em>“Descend is not for one with weak knees”</em> - Mahatma Gandhi</p> <p>Some of us raced, some lingered while others dragged themselves downhill with multiple sticks supporting their weak knees. A 75kg man fully leaning on a hollow steel stick decided the fate of a beloved comrade.</p> <p><em>RIP Trekking stick</em>.</p> <p>The sun peeked from the hills, rose high then started sinking and disappeared all the while we were walking downhill. The day soon lost its light but still ‘Lama Hotel’ was nowhere in sight. Wild bears and other unknowns in the jungle started nagging us with fear. We shouted and howled trying to scare off anything lurking in the dark. We started singing our lungs out like we wouldn’t see tomorrow. The atmosphere would switch from sad to aggressive and back to sad through every switch of the song. With lights flashing through our dim phone torches we started rocking the wild to our tune. The rain added more noise to our concert.</p> <p>With our throats sore from the jungle concert we arrived at Lama Hotel expecting some warm shelter and food. What awaited us was disappointment. The large number of travelers had overwhelmed every hotel in the area and now we were to push to <em>Rimche</em> through the dark of night. Another concert ensued on sore throats late night through the middle of the jungle.</p> <p>Tired to our bones, a descent from 4500m to 2450m had our knees shaking. We had supper and rested for a while calling our families informing them that we would be home tomorrow.</p> <p>We laid down watching the stars dance in the night sky. You could join these infinite dots to draw any contour you could imagine. The glowing faces of your loved ones, stick men figures fighting in slow motion, your favorite ‘Atari’ game, the possibilities are endless. The Lyrid meteor shower drew bright streaks across the sky as <em>Nandemonaiya</em> played on my phone.</p> <p><em>Enlightening.</em></p> <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2> <p>Part of the journey is the end. We woke up early in the morning thinking of home and the stories we would tell upon our return. We were to catch the bus at 9 from Doman. The silhouette of mountains receded as we walked under the canopy of hills covered in Rhododendron. We flowed down with the Langtang river exploring any corner we might have missed on our ascend. Our conquest came to an end as we prepared ourselves for a ride back home.</p> <p>At Syabrubesi we had breakfast and looked for souvenirs Yak cheese, ghee and <em>churpi</em> among our prime targets. Alas, Syabru was out of stock and we had to plan a stop at Dhunche for supplies. We returned in a jam-packed bus swaying back and forth with the winding roads that led us back to the Kathmandu valley.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Travel"/><category term="snow,"/><category term="trek,"/><category term="mountains"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Living on the lap of mountains]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A trip to snowland</title><link href="https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2022/A-trip-to-snowland/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A trip to snowland"/><published>2022-02-14T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-14T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2022/A-trip-to-snowland</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2022/A-trip-to-snowland/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="a-trip-to-snowland">A trip to snowland</h2> <p>Two bikes, four people and a perfect trip, we sketched down our plan. But as ‘AL Green’ said, <em>“How can you stop the rain from falling down…?”</em> It rained cats and dogs on our plan. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the company grew to six, hills grew thicker with snow and the weather next day was clearer.</p> <p>The Facebook group was assembled at 6:00 pm a day before the trip, the official start of a trip these days. We planned our escape at 8:00pm from <em>Hari Chowk</em>. As it usually happens we started the ride at 8:00<em>NST</em> (Nepali Standard Time) thanks to the trash-can Siddhartha Bank calls an ATM, which debited my account and refused to spit out the cash. Who knew that the bank would conspire for my mom to win an argument yet again? Yeah.. she’d mentioned taking cash from home instead of going to the ATM but I trusted technology more than my mother and faced the consequences. Not a great start to the trip but thankfully it wasn’t the sign of things to come.</p> <p>Kishor Dai and I in <em>FZ</em>, Gaurav Dai and Manish Dai in <em>Xpulse</em>, and Manish Dai and Pramish Vai in <em>Gixxer</em>. A final look at google maps to note-down the number of some of the hotels at Ghorepani. Down jackets, faces covered with masks, woolen hats and goggles off we went… Silky smooth road in Hemja with mountains running abreast us. I was busy filming every moment as we rode past the spotless road and into a typical Nepali highway. As we rode towards Lumle, the weather got more chillier but we were well suited for the cold.</p> <p>We were famished by the time we stopped for lunch. Manoj dai, who I know from Pulchowk Campus, Gaurav and Kishor dai’s classmate, had recently been posted at the ward office in <em>Patichaur</em> and joined us for lunch. Manoj dai sponsored the lunch as a treat for his recent job posting. We had rice with fish curry which was known to be a speciality on the highway. It was the best fish curry I have ever had, and no it’s not just hunger speaking, it was genuinely finger licking good. I cannot say the same for the price though.</p> <p>We turned right from <em>MaalDhunga</em> towards <em>Beni bazaar</em> and it was like we switched to the dark side of the moon. Puddles, right in the middle of the road and the occurrences were multiple. Heavy reconstruction of the “highway” was going on which led to diversions. Slimy mud mixture, large broken rocks and water canals ruining the already disintegrated highway. A major blockade was a truck loaded with gas cylinders stuck on the muddy road. Even a dozer was unable to pry the truck out. Luckily we had great riders. They expertly navigated from beside the truck and we were off again after a slight delay.</p> <p>We stopped to regroup on <em>Beni bazaar</em>, miniature under a hanging cliff . Cannot say that none of us were tempted to go rogue and change course when we found out that it was the same road that led to Mustang. The state of the highway though, uff… no wonder Myagdi district is on the list of <em>bikat</em> districts.</p> <p><em>Next stop Pokhare-bagar.</em></p> <p>At <em>Pokhare-bagar</em> we stopped for snacks and a short break from the long tiring ride. A casual chat to the locals revealed that we were late on schedule and it might get pitch dark by the time we reached Ghorepani. They also mentioned that the snow in some parts is hip-deep. So we rang Hotel Snowland and booked a package for six. The road got worse as we ascended. The sun sank and it started to grow dark. The road was still muddy and fractured but it was the snow that created all the problems. Snow on the sides and ice on the road made it impossible to create traction. Our riders got to experience riding a snowmobile at 8pm on a winter night on a road like no other. There were moments when it wasn’t the bike carrying us but the opposite. Skidding and sliding we made our way to the end of the road.</p> <p>We were still an hour away from the hotel. We moved through the middle of the forest without any idea of where the small slit of foot trails in the snow led. We had to wander around for sometime before we found the right trail on the thick snow. Finally after a long walk, we reached Hotel Snowland. It was about 10pm when we reached the hotel. Soaked in snow we gathered around the hearth to heat ourselves and our clothes for the journey tomorrow.</p> <p>It was 5:30am when I woke up to <em>Sia’s Greatest</em>. No sign of life in the room as our tired souls were in a state of deep sleep. Full of energy and determined not to miss the sunrise I climbed out of my bed and was ready in a minute. I started waking everyone up but some of us were too tired to walk in the snow again. So it was just half of the company that left at 6:15am to Poonhill. The estimated time for sunrise was 7:00am. With the clock ticking we set off in the snow.</p> <p>The morning glow was mesmerizing. We were late and were possibly going to miss the sunrise but the view was one to die for. We couldn’t wait till the top to capture those moments so we started posing here and there, adding to our delay. A sea of golden red above a silver lake and us floating in it. The first rays of sunlight on the peak of Annapurna South stirred my emotions. I summoned all my might and started running towards the hill, yes run. Panting, clambering, slipping, on all fours but not stopping.</p> <p>We reached the top just as the sun was shying away from the hill that hid it from us. Golden hill, silver lake and crystal white mountains. Ohh, did I let that view sink in. It was then time to let the floodgates open. We went about clicking pictures left, right and center. Acrobatics in the snow, casual poses, dancing, jumping, sleeping, diving, trust falls, cool-dude, and whatnot cause who knows if I will ever be there again. Never had I ever taken so many pictures.</p> <p>You can never have your fill with mountains but you must depart nonetheless. We started our descent after enough time at the top. The hills below seemed to be afloat in a lake of clouds, the trees shaking off the snow stuck in their branches and the clouds rising up to meet the mountain peaks. We slipped and slid our way back to the hotel.</p> <p>Breakfast beckoned at the hotel. The journey home began soon after. A click of our company of seven, six of us and a snowman as a final souvenir. Vlogging, skidding and dancing in the knee deep snow, we got back to Chitre where we had parked our bikes overnight.</p> <p>The sun had melted away a few layers of snow. The meltwater flowed down the road adding to the mud and puddles. Better mud than snow for us bikers. We descended slowly on our bikes, ever so careful of the pitfalls of a rural road. We had come unscathed from the toughest part of the highway, but Galeshwor Mahadev had planned a different end to our journey.</p> <p>Near Galeshwor, one of our bike’s roller chains broke. We had to push the bike to <em>Beni bazaar</em> for repair. An additional time cost was added to our plans, and by the time we left Beni for Pokhara it was already 7pm. We rode slowly on the pitch dark and empty highway. The visibility was also diminished by thick mist through which you could barely see. Cold that burned like a steel knife pierced through our trousers as we made our way back home at 11.</p> <p>Like every travel story it was lively, engrossing and memorable. The story is never complete without a bit of setback. On an ending note I’d like to add from this experience; little snow is dear, a little more is loved and too much is an avalanche but damn did we enjoy the avalanche.</p> <h3 id="psst">Psst…</h3> <p><em>NST - Nepali Standard Time, usually an hour or two late from the promised time.</em><br/> <em>Bikat - underdeveloped</em><br/> <em>FZ, Xpulse, Gixxer - bikes</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Travel"/><category term="ride,"/><category term="snow,"/><category term="hike"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poonhill]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Buildup to the Finale</title><link href="https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2021/post-two/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Buildup to the Finale"/><published>2021-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2021/post-two</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2021/post-two/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="uefa-champions-league-final-2021">UEFA Champions League Final 2021</h2> <p>It’s here, and we have been here before, but its different. There’s fear for the repeat of 2008 but there’s hope for the 2012 miracle. It’s 2021 and we come to ‘Estadio de Dragao’ as underdogs. Dread the fight but just enough to not let your arrogance get to you, believe that you can and will triumph on your quest, and live, live the moment like you’ll never live it again because you might just never live it again.</p> <h3 id="t--18-hours">T- 18 hours</h3> <p>It’s the 90th minute of the match and Chelsea are a goal down. Everyone’s eyes are on the clock. The rythmic heart-beats getting more intense. Panting, they jostle for every loose ball. Hands in face, praying, begging to anyone who is listening, shouting at the screen like you are there on the pitch.</p> <p>A golden opportunity for Chelsea comes by…. and ….GOALLL….. its 1-1. But wait…. obscurity, the picture’s getting blurr, and it seems like its Crystal Palace who’ve scored and its against Barcelona…. Did your excitement just switch teams. What’s going on… the game began as a match between Manchester City and Chelsea the Champions League Final… , what’s the scoreline in Chelsea’s game…., oh shoot did I fall asleep during the game. You start gaining consciousness and things slowly start to sink in.</p> <p>Its Match-Day. You want to take a sigh of relief and reflect on that weird dream. They have been getting weirder each passing day as the final edges closer. Nervousness is an understatement for what football fans feel before a game starting as underdogs, specially when its ‘the’ Final. Your mind is fixated on that one prize. You cannot concentrate on any task. Everything and anything reminds you of the game to come in about 18-hours. Flashbacks and discussions are all you want to do all day until kickoff. You’ve even started becoming superstitious start to feel as if whatever you do or do not do might have an effect on the game to come. You are weak on your knees, a spectator from far away, imagine what the player’s are going through.</p> <h3 id="t-12-hours">T-12 hours</h3> <p>The players are taking a walk around the city and you are following the action in Porto from your living room every minute as fans gather around the ‘Estadio de Dragao’. Tactics talks and line-up predictions begin but we are all too superstitious to predict the final score, having seen that when we make predictions before a game it ends up in defeat. Pep, the genius, what has he got planned to decimate us or what Tuchel has up his sleeve this time to make three in a row against the genius. Talks go on about Pep having won all the finals he’s played since 2011, and has lost only one in 12 finals. On the other side he’s never beaten Chelsea in the Champions league playing 3 games 2 draws and a loss. History suggesting no first time finalist has won the CL, and so on as facts begin to come to light with the main event edging closer.</p> <h3 id="t-1-and-a-half-hour">T-1 and a half hour</h3> <p>The lineups drop, half an hour earlier than in any other game. Chelsea’s lineup as expected Mendy in goal, Azpilicueta©, Silva, Rudiger, James, Kante, Jorginho, Chilwell, Mount, Werner, Havertz. A strong team on paper, players in good form and possibly the best team we could have hoped for. Then comes City’s lineup : Ederson, Walker, Stones, Dias, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Foden, B.Silva, Sterling, De-bruyne, Mahrez. You look at their lineup again and realize there’s no DM(Defensive Midfielder). Everyone goes crazy half of them saying Pep’s made a blunder starting the final without a DM and and the other half saying more attacking players, we’re going to get decimated. And discussions begin yet again. Who might score? Who is going to rise to the occasion? Who’s going to fight for that inch? Who’s gonna have the guts to take the last penalty if it goes to penalties?</p> <h3 id="kickoff">Kickoff</h3> <p>A tight tense game kicked off and fans were biting their nails from the very beginning. Manchester City as always cool composed on the ball as Chelsea formed a defensive block which had been nearly impenetrable since Tuchel arrived. Touch tight passing, fans cheering and players giving it their all made for a great cup final. Chelsea dangerous on the break, City patient and probing… Clock ticks to the 42nd minute of the game with the ball at the Mendy’s feet. A long ball to the left is flicked first time by Ben Chilwell to the rushing Mason Mount. Mount turns. Timo Werner draggs the center back away from the center creating a passing lane for Mount to play Havertz in on goal. Ederson rushes.. Kai gets there first.. ball bounces off the keeper and Kai has an empty net infront of him. GOALLL…… The most expensive player in Chelsea Football Club’s history repays the 90 million quid with a kick of the ball. The half-time score</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Chelsea 1-0 Manchester City.  
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The players come in for the second half. Another half of stand your ground and fight for Chelsea as for City a show of their character. The Champions of England need to push further to get the European Crown. The game progressed and the belief among the Chelsea fans and players seemed to be ever more rising. Crunching tackles, fearsome, resolute and dogged Chelsea were impenetrable to the free flowing and slick football of Manchester City.</p> <p>94th minute on the clock and still Chelsea hold the slender lead. It falls to the feet of Riyad Mahrez, just outside the box from a throw-in… and MAHREZZ…. Flashbacks run through the minds of Chelsea fans, that John Terry miss, the moment Chelsea fans covered their eyes in horror to an Andreas Iniesta equalizer in injury time, all rushing through our minds as the ball slowly floated towards the net.<br/> Agonizingly close but the ball doesn’t strike the back of the net this time.</p> <h3 id="full-time">Full-Time</h3> <p><strong>THEY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN. EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS AFTER 9 YEARS. ECSTASY FOR CHELSEA AT THE EXPENSE OF MANCHESTER CITY’S HEARTBREAK.</strong></p> <p>The European Dream not to be for Pep Guardiola. Thomas Tuchel, finally gets his hands on the trophy which he missed by a whisker last season. The Chelsea fans rejoice singing, <em>“We’ve got Super Tommy Tuchel and he knows exactly what we need! Thiago in the back Timo in attack, Chelsea gonna win the Champions League.”</em> and I join in the chant from my living room.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Football"/><category term="everyday"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Champions of Europe]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Groundhog Day</title><link href="https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2020/post-one/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Groundhog Day"/><published>2020-05-28T09:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-28T09:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2020/post-one</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sandeshpokhrel54.github.io/blog/2020/post-one/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="life-during-the-lockdown">Life during the lockdown</h2> <p>Yet another day has come to an end, and like the past two months, I am scratching my head thinking what things I did today were “productive”. I lay there in my bed recalling the early morning row with my mom because I overslept yet again.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Mom vs me (1-0), if we are keeping scores.  It really pissed me off for the first few weeks or so, but I guess, I got used to her rants.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Definitely not a good start to the day. Popping a <em>pantop</em>, I sat there waiting for that <em>not so early</em> morning acidity to go away. Mom walks in with a plate of sliced beetroot, carrots, apples and a glass of lukewarm water preaching about what some Facebook post said about the benefits of lukewarm water in an empty stomach.</p> <p>The row we had forgotten about over a loving plate of fruits. I didn’t like the taste of beetroot when I first tried it, a month ago but now it had really grown onto me. The muddy smell it gave used to be worse a month ago as I recall. Now, even the red tint it leaves on the whites I always wear doesn’t seem to bother me.</p> <p>Just when the plate is empty, the fruits had done their job, and I found myself rushing for the washroom. Scrolling through the social media feeds as I clear my bowels, I stumble upon news that your rival’s transfers aren’t working out while your club is busy swooping in <em>generational</em> players.</p> <p>Half an hour or so of reading the book you were so into and it is lunchtime. I eat whatever mom has prepared for lunch, facetiously complaining that she’s put too much besar in the curry. She gives me a look that reads, ‘You ought to have prepared whatever you liked insted of sleeping till noon.’ and adds that Mr. Prime Minister has said it helps fight covid.</p> <p>I don’t bother explaining and getting into an argument again, so I just finish my meal and get up. Finally, I turn on my laptop, <em>rubbing my palms</em>, let’s get to work, but wait… what am I supposed to do today? Like I had done anything yesterday. Checking a list of items, I have in my to-do list:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Skyrim (FYI the best game ever)  
GTA IV  
Humble Pi (continue the book)  
Python / JS / C++ / other random stuff to learn  
A list of movies/series friends recommended  
A list of videos I bookmarked yesterday  
A bunch of papers/resources to read from  
</code></pre></div></div> <p>As I’m deciding what I want to do for the day, BAM!! Social media takes over!</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Social media vs me (67-2). (Damn it’s gonna be a tough comeback, social media’s rather good at this.) Almost two hours flies by surfing between Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord and engaging in anything you find there.  
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when friends in group chat start talking about stuff but you can’t make out if its Sumerian or ancient Egyptian they are talking, you slap yourself into “productivity” and decide to continue the fractal (Koch curve) in JavaScript and get to work.</p> <p>The only bit of code you’ve managed today is ctx.draw( ), because without realizing you have started surfing on the internet which began from the search about <em>vertices of a triangle</em>.</p> <p>Not even an hour has passed before your butt cheeks are weary and your tummy rumbles. It’s about 3:30 when you can no longer bear the rumble of your tummy and call out to your mom for khaja, but she is nowhere to be found.</p> <p>I could sense her in our neighbors’ house complaining about the lousy son who wakes up late and doesn’t help her with chores. Corona or no, aunties got to chat.</p> <p>Let’s give her something good to talk about for tomorrow then. I <em>dramatically</em> enter the kitchen as I imagine myself in a chef’s clothes. Poor man’s Gordon Ramsay mode <em>activated</em>. Watching too much Gordon Ramsay videos might not make you a good chef, but one thing’s for sure, you’ll narrate the ingredients in your head as he does:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A fistful of spaghetti
Into boiling water (10 minutes wait, for it to be just the right texture)
Into the colander
A touch of olive oil 
        (that's what you say but you are pouring just a bit of *tori ko tel* 
        into the colander terrified your mom 
        would haunt you for pouring half a bottle of it for a fistful of spaghetti)
Pan. Heat. Oil.
Fry chopped tomato, garlic and onion. Blend.
Spaghetti into the plate; spread some grated cheese and the blended sauce.

Her eyes meet mine; wild west theme plays in the background, and she starts yelling at me about the state of the kitchen. I had made lassi topped with peanuts while waiting for the spaghetti to boil.</p> <p>“Bon apatite, mademoiselle”<br/> I serve her the dish with a glass of lassi. She runs her eyes over the neatly placed dish to find any missing ingredients. Ah ha! You forgot besar.</p> <p>“What good is chowmein without besar?” “And for the last time it’s not chowmein its spaghetti <em>Italian hand gesture</em>, just try, and tell me if is it any good?”</p> <p>Her fork rolls and gathers a bunch of spaghetti strands, cheese and the sauce.</p> <p>She tastes, <em>Anton Ego</em> style.<br/> “It’s actually good!”</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Mom vs me (1-1). Sweet equalizer, well tasty to be more precise.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Well, let’s continue the code and finish off the Koch curve.<br/> A few moments later,<br/> <em>Epic Saxo Guy rings under the pillow</em><br/> I pick up.<br/> “It’s almost five, you ready to go.”<br/> That cooking maneuver just took me an hour and half. Damn you, Gordon Ramsay. Gordon Ramsay inside me replies, as he usually does, in a cursed tone.</p> <p>I didn’t really want to go running then, so I replied “Well, I am kinda doing some coding, let’s skip for today”.</p> <p>“You said that yesterday. Now get ready, I’ll be there in 5 minutes.”</p> <p>Reluctantly, I change into my running shorts and shoes. But, changing into these gets me runner’s high and I start sprinting until my lungs can no longer handle. (Its lockdown, I know. I wore a mask and maintained distance).</p> <p>We’re running, striking up conversations and he mentions that he was hitting on some unknown girls and he started flirting with one of them. But the girl turned out to be a cousin of his classmate, and now he was embarrassed. Good for you, you can at least have a chat, I thought. I can’t even seem to have a conversation with anyone.</p> <p>A bunch of guys are flexing their rock-hard abs in the park. I put my hands on my belly and sigh as we go by.<br/> Soaked from head to toe, I return home, cool down and take a shower. I get back to the code and polish it for a while, and before long, it’s dinner time.</p> <p>Casual table talks commence. All of a sudden, mom and me are arguing about the number of Covid cases today. Unlike any other time, I was confident, and I placed a bet to do the dishes if she’s correct. Dad throws in his say and mom hers. For all the BBC radio news mom listens to and the Routiney dai ko post I follow, neither of us were correct.</p> <p>Dad <em>R.K.O’ed</em> us out of nowhere, and the final score now reads 2-1-1. I picked washing dishes over cleaning the kitchen. When we were done eating, I muffed my ears with my headphones and listened to Roy Dotrice narrate Ser Ilyn Payne lopping off Ned Starks head.<br/> Doing the dishes feels like a backdrop when you’re fully into the audiobook.</p> <p><em>Back to the code.</em><br/> A semicolon here, a bool there and it seemed like it was over. But alas! The canvas looked like a 3-year-old going nuts on a sketchpad before the browser crashed.</p> <p>Ten tutorials and forty Stack Overflow questions later, I found the bug was a negative sign missing while calculating the coordinates. Frustrated with myself for making such a silly mistake, I now had a strong urge to take it out on somebody.</p> <p>Loading up seems to take forever in this dang old PC, but the music makes the wait bearable. Kazin Niko starts firing and taking people’s limbs off with a Bazooka. When I’d had my fill from the bloodbath, it was bedtime, and I laid down scratching my head.</p> <p>In terms of productivity we had none today - so tuck yourself into bed, “hoping” to wake up early and put an end to that self-similar recursive piece of geometry.</p> <h3 id="understanding-my-language">Understanding my language</h3> <p><em>Pantop</em> – a medicine for gastritis<br/> <em>Kazin</em> – Cousin, in thick Eastern European accent, as pronounced in the game<br/> <em>Anton Ego</em> – The food critic in movie Ratatouille<br/> <em>Tori ko tel</em> – mustard oil<br/> <em>R.K.O’ed</em> – wrestling reference</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Everyday"/><category term="daily"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A New Normal during Covid]]></summary></entry></feed>
