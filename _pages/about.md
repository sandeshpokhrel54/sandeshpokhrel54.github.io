Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hi! I'm Sandesh Pokhrel, a passionate computer vision researcher at [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.org.np/) under Assistant Professor [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDEi58sAAAAJ). I am working at the forefront of medical imaging and its applications through computer vision and AI. My current research focuses on Out-of-Distribution detection in gastrointestinal vision in various modalities. I also lead a project on automatic coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in angiographic images in two hospitals in Nepal. My research at NAAMII is funded by Fogsphere where I research and optimize state of the art computer vision methods on edge devices for safety critical applications.

As a computer engineering graduate from [Institute of Engineering(IOE), Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), I have developed a diverse skill set in advanced AI and computer vision technologies. My expertise spans out-of-distribution detection, multi-modal learning, self-supervised learning, object detection and segmentation, pose estimation speech recognition and voice cloning. I specialize in applying these cutting-edge techniques to develop innovative software solutions that address critical real world challenges. My work focuses on bridging the gap between complex AI concepts and practical applications, driving meaningful impace across multiple domains.

As personal interests, I enthusiastically watch and play football, and am an avid star gazer on cloudless nights.

Looking forward to connecting with you!
